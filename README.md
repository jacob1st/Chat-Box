Just a regular chat box.
This project was created as an introduction to network programming using sockets in python as well as an introduction to using TKinter for GUI applications. 

To change your nickname type 'nickname=<new_nickname>'

To disconnect from the client side type '!DISCONNECT'. To quit the server type '!QUIT'. (Note: All in Caps)

*Tech with Tim has a video on youtube called "Python Socket Programming Tutorial" which I followed along with for the beginning of this project*
